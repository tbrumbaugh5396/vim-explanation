# Introduction to Vim
Vim is one of the most popular text editors among Linux users.
Linux System Administrators often prefer it to other editors.

Vim is an acronym that stands for Vi IMproved.
It is a free open-source cross-platform text editor that was first released by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 for Unix variants.

It is based on the original Vi editor, which was created in 1976 by Bill Joy.
